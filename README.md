# wonder
Travel camera that identifies landmarks and pulls relevant information.
Uses WikipediaKit API/Framework and Apple's AVFoundation to pull the nearest Wikipedia article, display the title to the screen,
and give interesting information about the landmark.
"Did you know?" button pulls a random "fun fact" about the landmark.
